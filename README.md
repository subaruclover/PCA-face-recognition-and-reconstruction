# PCA-face-recognition-and-reconstruction

I mainly illustrated my understanding of Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Codes are in MATLAB, and I tried one numerical example to see how it works with some made-up data and two more practical examples to show how it works in face recognition. One of them uses the faces I collected from the people I know in OIST while the other uses the faces from ORL faces database.
