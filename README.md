# PCA-face-recognition-and-reconstruction

Principle Component Analysis (PCA). Codes are in MATLAB, and I tried one numerical example to see how it works with some made-up data and two more practical examples to show how it works in face recognition. One of them uses the faces I collected from the people I know in OIST while the other uses the faces from ORL faces database.

code_data_example1 : made up data with 2 dimensions for testing each step of how PCA works.

code_data_example2 : collected 10 different people’s faces, each has 3 different emotions data sets and tried PCA method to recognize which face it is (based on the eigenfaces). The resolution of the faces is N=180 * 200 and the number of the train data set is M=20.

code_data_example3 : I used the ORL faces database(can be downloaded from online open sources) which has 40 different people’s faces, each has 10 images. The resolution of the faces is 112 * 92.
